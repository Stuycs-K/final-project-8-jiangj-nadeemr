Final Project: Ludo Gameboard
## Overview
Ludo is played on a square board divided into four colored quadrants, with each quadrant representing a player's home base. The goal is to move all four of your colored game tokens from your home base to the center of the board, known as “triangle/home." In order to move the token, players take turns rolling a dice and moving their pieces based on the number rolled. The game incorporates strategic decision-making as players can choose to either move their existing pieces forward or bring new pieces into play. There are also special abilities such as being able to send an enemy token back home given that you land on the same spot as one of their tokens. 
## Instructions

In order to **start** a game:
Click the play Button! You will be prompted to select a color for your user, you can pick any. (Note: you will always go first, no matter which color you pick!)

The game is split into different modes in order to test different aspects of the game quickly. The mode will be displayed on top of the scoreboard and will range from 0 - 4. Below are the descriptions
of each mode. You can move onto the next mode by clicking any key. Default is at mode 0.

- Mode 0: This is **regular gameplay!** There are no special modifications, you will be able to test user turns here and being able to roll the dice to move your token (note: you need to roll a 6 in order to 
move a token outside of the homebase. Once you roll a 6, you can click on the token to get it out of the homebase. If you roll and you already have tokens on the board, you can click on the token you want
to move.) All the other players are bots; they move randomly (based on probability). You can see what's going on with the scoreboard as it updates when the bots move.

- Mode 1: Tokens will be spawned right next to each other (rigged to do so). Click on the dice so this can happen. This mode is to setup token interaction (killing another token). 

- Mode 2: Extension to mode 1; the dices will be rigged to only roll ones. In mode 1, the tokens are placed right next to each other. Now that you are in mode 2, you can click on the dice
and see tokens getting killed/sent back to their home bases. This mode is to highlight token interactions.

- Mode 3: This sets up the next mode. A token is spawned right before it's entrance to the end point. 3 tokens are set to be finished, so you only have one token left.

- Mode 4: Now that you have a token positioned at the entrance of the end point, the game will roll all 2's so you can get your token into the end point and thus win the game. You need to get 
the exact number on your dice in order to reach the end point (for example: you're 3 spaces away from the end point and you roll a 4, you can't go in). Hence, we roll 2's so you don't have
to keep on rolling until you get the right amount of spaces.
