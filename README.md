Final Project: Ludo Gameboard
## Overview
Ludo is played on a square board divided into four colored quadrants, with each quadrant representing a player's home base. The goal is to move all four of your colored game tokens from your home base to the center of the board, known as “triangle/home." In order to move the token, players take turns rolling a dice and moving their pieces based on the number rolled. The game incorporates strategic decision-making as players can choose to either move their existing pieces forward or bring new pieces into play. There are also special abilities such as being able to send an enemy token back home given that you land on the same spot as one of their tokens. 
## Instructions
*Note:* these instructions do not apply to demo branch, demo is a pre-made game.
In order to **start** a game:
- click the dice on the top right of your screen, this will count as the **Red** player's turn.
- continue clicking on the dice to move onto different players (this *will* be automated post-demo, bots will control the other color(s))
- the scoreboard provides **live** information such as how many tokens you have left to win for each color.
- in order to **kill** an enemy, you need to land on the same spot as them. Upon doing so, the user will automatically be killed.
- in order to enter the triangle, you must go around the entire board (your token will move towards the direction of the arrow)
- once you reach the entrance of the triangle, you can roll the dice into the triangle.
- when *all* 4 tokens of *any* player are all in the triangle, the game will end (wip) and that user has won the game!
