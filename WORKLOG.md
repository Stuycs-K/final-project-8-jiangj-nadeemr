# Work Log

## Jonathan J

### 5/22/2023 CW

I finished setting up the shell for the User Class and writing annotations for each method in the class.

### 5/22/2023 HW

I added some code for the methods in the User class, they are still incomplete because it requires for some of the methods in the token class to be set up, but the core of the methods are there.

### 5/23/2023 CW
 
I finished the accessor methods for the User Class and designed the gameboard and how it would look. Going to work on implementing the constructor now.

### 5/23/2023 HW

Finished the gameboard method.

### 5/24/2023 CW

Worked on converting the gameboard method array into a processing drawing.

### 5/24/2023 HW

Worked on incorporating the red tokens into the processing drawing, will use the code to do the other colors.

### 5/25/2023 CW

Finished on getting all the colored tokens into their respective homeyards and started the method to allow them to move out of their homeyard.

### 5/25/2023 HW

Worked on simplifying the code in the game class so it's easier to work on and then I started working on more code for the user class. Was able to get the accessor methods done and started new ideas for the swapping of turns.

### 5/26/2023 CW

Worked on correcting the spawn method so the tokens would move out of the homeyard in the correct destinations. Then I was able to test the move method with the simplified code and it worked, but I had to do a lot of debugging since the code was so messy.

### 5/26/2023 HW

Worked on the mouseClicked method but it didn't work, going to try to figure out why even though I click on a specific token, it only moves one specific token. Also was able to start new methods for new ideas with the turn based mechanics.

### 5/22/2023

CW: I finished the setting up the Ludo class with all the annotations for each method in the class.
HW: Finished some methods for Ludo and finish the Ludo constructor. Still waiting on certain classes to be completed before doing the other methods.

### 5/23/2023
CW: Worked on designing the gameboard and how it would work. Also added Token class with annotations
HW: Finished some methods for Token class and finished its constructor.

### 5/24/2023
CW: Worked with Jonathan in-class to create the board on processing -- got the sketch on processing sucessfully.
HW: Worked on trying to move the tokens based on what Jonathan made; added tokens to green home base.

### 5/25/2023
CW: Worked on adding tokens to each spawn (picked up from where Jonathan left off). Worked on token movement logic, got horizontal movement working. Added checkTouching() method!
HW: Worked on moving one token from each base outside of the homebase; discussed ways to improve codebase to prevent repetitive code. Almost complete with some phases.
