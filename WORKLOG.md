### 5/22/2023 CW

I finished setting up the shell for the User Class and writing annotations for each method in the class.

### 5/22/2023 HW

I added some code for the methods in the User class, they are still incomplete because it requires for some of the methods in the token class to be set up, but the core of the methods are there.
