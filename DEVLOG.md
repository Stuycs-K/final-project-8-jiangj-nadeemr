## Development Log
Working Features:
- Scoreboard to display live updates to game (all 4 users are displayed. 3 users are bots)
- Start menu allowing user to pick color. Sound plays when color is picked successfully.
- Different modes to test different mechanics of the game (interactions, winning, gameplay)
- Token movement & animation
- Dice roll & dice sound effect
- Token interactions (one token kills the other and sends it back to its homebase)
- Automatic roll dice for the 3 users (bots). Delays between each turn to see what's going on. Sped up movement for bots.
Broken Features:
- "Block" feature -- essentially, if there were **two** tokens of the same color on one space and a token of a different color lands on that space, it would
get sent back to its homebase since the two tokens act as a block. Was half-working and decided to scrap it out because it wasn't working properly.
Content resources:
- Only the Processing References were used.
